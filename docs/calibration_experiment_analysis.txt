1. Each trascription repressor was induced to the maximum level
2. The total flouresence was measured, after background subtracting the total flouresence from each cell in the absence of induction
3. The cells were lysed and the protein purified, and quantified in nanograms
4. The flouresence from an individual cell will be much lower - the conversion factor between pixel intensities and the arbitrary units in the calibration
   effort was determined to be 1e7 using reference flourophores.
